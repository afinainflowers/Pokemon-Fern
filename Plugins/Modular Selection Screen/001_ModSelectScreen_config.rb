# Modular Selection Screen v1.0
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Based on Advanced Flexible Starter Selection by Limnodromus and Shiney570
# Edited and modified by CourteousGrizzly
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Provides a callable method to select from multiple pokemon for a starter
# selection screen or other gifted pokemon choice.
# Default method can be reused with a different selection of pokemon using only
# the arguments in the script event, but has limited configurability.
# Advanced method must be hard-coded within the script and copied to another
# method if multiple selections are desired, but offers high configurability.

# Version: 1.0.0
